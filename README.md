## House Prediction using Both Images and Textual Information

------------
#### Abstract : 
House market plays an important role in shaping the economy. Recent studies shows there has been increase in sales rate of houses. In this project we propose an automatic house price prediction that can help retailers and customers to make a decision. The traditional methods involved use of textual information like area, its neighbourhood, no of bedrooms etc. In this project we propose finding an estimation using categorical, numerical as well as visual (images) dataset. We will make use of keras architecture that accepts multiple inputs and data. We will combine both textual and visual inputs and train a model which has input as mixed data.

#### Dataset Used : https://github.com/emanhamed/Houses-dataset
